                                To say what superpower I have is almost hard to describe. What I possess is not only a superpower but a secret weapon. Creativity, a seemingly normal trait is something that I take pride in, what I hone, and what I try to exercise in al parts of my life. Using my imagination has always been prevalent in every project or assignment I do. Because of my creativity and willingness to put out the best work, there are many opportunities open to me that otherwise would be closed off. Not only does it affect my work but I can use it in my works and social life. I can PLUS ULTRA even in trying moments, bringing out the best in my work and other people. I firmly believe that with creativity, there can be so much to raise a person's spirit and mood.

                                Tech901 was an obvious choice when it came to finding more programs and mentorship to continue my schooling on code. I was fortunate to participate in some coding events by Tech901 held for kids interested in technology, whether it was for gaming or creating your working blog or website. I participated in Code School for three months learning Python, Java, CSS, HTML, and Django. Now that I am attending Southwest for programming, I want to get a head start and leg-up for my classes. I want to gain a comprehensive speed and coding skills too not only pass my classes but be career-ready for the workspace.
